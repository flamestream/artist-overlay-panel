Welcome to the Taction Panel Designer!

This is an early version of the application. As such, not all supported features are implemented yet. Here is a list of missing items and known issues:

* No radial menu support.
* No `pivot` item support.
* No image content property support.
* No preview fort active style (You may still set them in the designer).
* Only `png` format can be imported for images at the moment.
* Only `ttf` format can be imported for font.
* System look-up fonts may not be used as custom font.
* Gradient angle cannot be set.

Please look forward to having all these points addressed in the future.
