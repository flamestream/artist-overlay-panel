Welcome to the Taction Panel Designer!

This is an early version of the application. As such, not all supported features are implemented yet. Also, please note that it is currently only designed to be used with Google Chrome.

### What's New

* Properties definition are now component-like.
* Active style can be previewed.
* A more user-friendly key command editor is available. Simply press the desired key when focusing on the text field to have the code generated.
* Resetting the layout gives you the choice of 4 different templates.
* Partial radial menu support. Only the main item is editable on layouts that have them defined.
* Image content can now be colorized and have defined margins.

### Still Missing

* No `pivot` item support.
* No advanced image content property support. (tile, stretch)
* No preview for image background color.
* Only `png` format can be imported for images.
* Only `ttf` format can be imported for font.
* System look-up font names may not be used as custom font.
* Gradient angle cannot be set.
* Cannot create `radial-menu` item.

Please look forward to having all these points addressed in the future.
