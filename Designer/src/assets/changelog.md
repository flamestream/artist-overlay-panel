Welcome to the Taction Panel Designer!

This is an early version of the application. As such, not all supported features are implemented yet. Here is a list of missing items and known issues:

* No radial menu support.
* No `pivot` item support.
* No image content property support. (stretch, colorize...)
* No preview for active style. (You may still set them in the designer)
* No preview for image color.
* Only `png` format can be imported for images.
* Only `ttf` format can be imported for font.
* System look-up font names may not be used as custom font.
* Gradient angle cannot be set.
* Key command is currently low level input.

Please look forward to having all these points addressed in the future.
